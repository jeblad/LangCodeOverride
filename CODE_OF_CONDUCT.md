# Code of Conduct

The development of this software within Wikimedia spaces are covered by a [Code of Conduct](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct).

Note that main development of this extension is outside Wikimedia, on [GitHub](https://github.com/jeblad/LangCodeOverride/) and [TranslateWiki](https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Special:Translate/ext-pickle), and thus not covered by this policy. It should although be taken as good advice. On Wikimedia spaces, like Gerrit, it is in effect.
